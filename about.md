Hello, my name is Xianglin Huang. Welcome to my personal website. You can find my essays about the Romani from my ENG 101 class. The Romani migration history is fascinating, but the current circumstances of some Romani people are very concerning. You will also find my reflective letter, which describes how my writing has improved during the course.

I am so glad you found my ePortfolio, and I hope you enjoy it.

Xianglin
