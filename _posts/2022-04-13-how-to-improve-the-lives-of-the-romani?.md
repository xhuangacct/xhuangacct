How to Improve the Lives of the Romani?

The Romani (also called Roma or Gypsies) are an ethnic group of people who used to live a nomadic lifestyle and now mainly live in Europe (Britannica). For a long time, the majority of Romani, especially the Boxcar Communities, have been living with low income and poor housing and health conditions. Many European countries have decided to improve their situation by adopting strategies of Roma integration, which include the education of Roma. Better educational opportunities would have increased Boxcar Romani job eligibility and, in turn, their standards of living.

HISTORICAL CONTEXT

The Romani people originally lived in Northern India. Their migration dated back to the 8th century AD (Britannica). By the beginning of the 14th century, the Romani people were known in every single country in Eastern Europe. They lived as minorities and were called different names in different countries. In history, there were Romani people who lived with high status and wealth (Brew). However, the majority of them were somehow impoverished within all European countries. This was especially evident in Bulgaria.

BULGARIA'S BOXCAR COMMUNITY

Bulgaria is located in Eastern Europe at latitude 42.3755° N and longitude 25.1629°(“Where Is Bulgaria”). It has a population of approximately 7.4 million people. According to official records, about 5% of the Bulgarian population are Roma. Among all of the minorities in Bulgaria, the Roma people are the least educated. Only 7.2% of Roma acquired secondary or higher education, while the corresponding  proportion of the total population in Bulgaria is 76.5% (“Introduction to Roma in Bulgaria”). Most Bulgarian Roma can not get a quality education because of segregated schools and high dropout rate at an early age. As a result, they commonly suffer from unemployment and low income, which can lead to extremely bad housing conditions and health status for them. Being poorly educated, they can not speak for themselves even when they are treated unfairly. 

In a documentary film named “Welcome Nowhere”, a group of Bulgarian Roma were evicted from their homes by the government and thus lived in crowded train boxcars without bathrooms or showers. They could not get hired, either because they had a low level of education, or simply because they were disliked. Most of the Boxcar Romani lived by searching the trash cans. They collected garbage home to take advantage of the valuable parts and dumped the rest everywhere. Their community was covered with garbage and thus drew complaints from their neighboring communities, which made them even more unpopular. The Boxcar Romani children also suffered from these conditions. Being exposed to the unhygienic conditions, they got sick easily. They skipped school frequently and barely learned anything. In the film, an 8-year-old girl who attended school did not know the alphabet, and a 10-year-old boy could not read a word. This situation lasted for almost twelve years until a new mayor moved them into government apartments in September 2012 (Ryan).

EDUCATION AND THE IMPOVERISHED BULGARIAN ROMA

While moving out of the boxcars finally ended the extremely poor situation of the Bulgarian Boxcar Roma, it can be inferred that their lives might not get much better in government apartments. As long as they could not find normal jobs, they would continue their way of living. The social and cultural exclusion against them could not change either. It would not take too long before they littered their community with garbage again. Finally, they would be still under bad conditions. 

Joblessness is undoubtedly the basic reason that leads to poverty for the Roma. The lack of jobs causes the lack of income, which will keep the Roma from better lives no matter where they live. Therefore, what needs to be done first is to strengthen their capability of different kinds of jobs, which will lead to more employment and higher income for the Roma. Acquiring a quality education is the best way to start one’s career. Many jobs, especially the high-paid jobs, require a bachelor or higher degree. Many other jobs require at least a high school diploma. If a Roma person can earn such degrees, there will be plenty more job opportunities for him/her. With a better education, the Roma will be qualified to start their career, to set up their academic or professional goals, and to pursue a better life. 

However, the Roma still have a long way to go. The state of their education is not very optimistic. Many Roma children irregularly attend school or drop out due to economic issues ("Introduction to Roma in Bulgaria"). Some Roma parents would hold back their children especially girls from school because they don't want them to learn modern thoughts and disrespect their traditions (Stein). Besides, the Roma have a tradition of getting married at a relatively young age, which will also decrease their possibility of acquiring higher level education.

CONCLUSION

Despite the numerous obstacles in the way, obtaining a better education remains the only way to ensure improvements for the Romani people. Better education will not only improve their job capability and eligibility, but also help them change their minds to pursue a healthier and more positive lifestyle and to support their children's intelligence development. Above all, there is no doubt that with better educational opportunities, the Romani are more likely to find jobs and thus improve their standards of living.
