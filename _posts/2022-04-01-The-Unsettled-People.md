<p style="text-align: center;">The Unsettled People</p>

The Romani (also called Roma or Gypsies) are an ethnic group of people who live a nomadic lifestyle (Britannica). They are known for their regular migration from one town to the next. However, “all unsettled confederations who live among settled peoples seem to become convenient scapegoats” (Britannica). During their lifetime, the Romani will have to face regulations from local authorities, accusations from local communities, and persecutions from the local legislative body. The Romani are arguably the most persecuted minority in Eastern Europe as exemplified by the Bulgarian Roma "boxcar" community experience.

The Romani people originally lived in Northern India. Their migration dated back to the 8th century AD (Britannica). By the beginning of the 14th century, the Romani people were known in every single country in Eastern Europe. They lived as minorities and were called different names In different countries. In history, there were Romani people who lived with high status and wealth (Brew). However, the majority of them were somehow impoverished within all European countries. This was especially evident in Bulgaria.

Bulgaria is located in Eastern Europe at latitude 42.3755° N and longitude 25.1629°(“Where Is Bulgaria”). It has a population of approximately 7.4 million people. According to official records, about 5% of the Bulgarian population are Roma. Among all of the minorities in Bulgaria, the Roma people are the least educated. Only 7.2% of Roma acquired secondary or higher education, while the corresponding  proportion of the total population in Bulgaria is 76.5% (“Introduction to Roma in Bulgaria”). Most Bulgarian Roma can not get a quality education because of segregated schools and high dropout rate at an early age. As a result, they commonly suffer from unemployment and low income, which can lead to extremely bad housing conditions and health status for them. Being poorly educated, they can not speak for themselves even when they are treated unfairly. 

According to a documentary film named “Welcome Nowhere”, a group of Bulgarian Roma were evicted from their homes by the government and thus lived in crowded train boxcars without bathrooms or showers. They could not get hired, either because they had a low level of education, or simply because they were disliked. Most of the Boxcar Romani lived by searching the trash cans. They collected garbage home to take advantage of the valuable parts and dumped the rest everywhere. Their community was covered with garbage and thus drew complaints from their neighboring communities, which made them even more unpopular. The Boxcar Romani children also suffered from these conditions. Being exposed to the unhygienic conditions, they got sick easily. They skipped school frequently and barely learned anything. In the film, an 8-year-old girl who attended school did not know the alphabet, and a 10-year-old boy could not read a word. This situation lasted for almost twelve years until a new mayor moved them into government apartments in September 2012 (Ryan).

Even though the Roma have moved out of the Boxcar Community, they still have to face the social and cultural exclusion from the mainstream society. They are hated wherever they go since they are the unsettled people. It is noticeable that the Romani are the most persecuted minority throughout Eastern Europe and that the Bulgarian Roma "boxcar" community experience is only one example of their collective experiences.
