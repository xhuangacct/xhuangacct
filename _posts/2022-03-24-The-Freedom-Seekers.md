<p style="text-align: center;">The Freedom Seekers</p>

The Romani (also known as Roma or Gypsies) are “an ethnic group of traditionally itinerant people” (Britannica). They are born with a love of freedom. During their lifetime, the Romani regularly move from one town to the next seeking their freedom, thus their lives periodically overlap with those of other people from different cultures. The Romani have what is arguably the most interesting migration history of any world ethnicity. 

The Romani lead a nomadic life-style and often travel across borders. According to Wikipedia, the earliest migration of the Romani happened between the 8th and 10th centuries AD. Based on the fact that their language deeply resembles Indian languages, linguists inferred that their ancestors lived in the northwest part of India (Wikipedia contributors). From the 11th century to the 15th century, the Romani chronologically reached Persia, southeastern Europe, and western Europe through repeated migrations (Britannica). By the second half of the 20th century they appeared all around the world(Britannica), especially in Eastern Europe. 

The migration history of the Romani makes them freedom seekers. They move from country to country regardless of national boundaries. This distinct habit makes their migration history the most attractive of all world ethnicities.
