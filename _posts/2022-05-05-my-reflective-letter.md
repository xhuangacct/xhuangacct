Dear Portfolio Committee:
 
Thank you for reviewing my ENG 101 ePortfolio. I believe you will find evidence of my progress in the ENG 101 class. I am taking this class so that I can improve my English proficiency and build up my knowledge of accounting. After graduation, I plan to pursue an accounting-related career. To achieve my goal, I must be able to write clearly and coherently.
 
The most important thing I learned in ENG 101 was to correct the Comma Splice and Run-on sentences. Before taking the class, I often wrote such sentences and did not know they were grammarly wrong. Now I can avoid making such writing mistakes. In addition, I learned about the requirements of essay structure and format, and by practicing them with the assignments, I am able to write more organized essays now. Moreover, the professor gave me specific advice on where I was lacking and incoherent after I submitted my essay drafts each time. With more and more practice, I learned how to polish my paragraphs and transitions.  
 
During ENG 101, I attended every class meeting and stuck to the instructions. As my writing skills improved, I became more confident and self-reliant. When I turned to the tutorial services, the tutors showed me how to strengthen my essays by illustrating the methods in detailed examples. I benefited from their teaching and gradually became able to proofread my own writing.
 
Thank you again for the opportunity to present my ePortfolio. If you have further questions, I can be reached by email at huang0000lin@gmail.com. I pledge that all the writing included in the attached portfolio is my own.
 
Sincerely,
 
Xianglin Huang
